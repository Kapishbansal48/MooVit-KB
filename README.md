# MooVit

MooVit is an AI-powered real-time object detection and voice-assist system designed to improve road safety and mobility—especially for visually impaired users, logistics operations, and vehicle drivers. It detects people, vehicles, traffic signals, animals, dangerous objects, and known faces. MooVit offers voice alerts for real-time navigation, shipment scheduling assistance, route optimization, and road safety awareness.
