# 🚦 MooVit: AI-Powered Road Safety & Assistance

Welcome to **MooVit**!  
An AI-driven, real-time object detection and voice assistance platform designed to enhance road safety, assist visually impaired users, and optimize logistics operations.

---

## 🚗 What It Does

- **Real-Time Object Detection**  
  Detects vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signals, animals, sharp objects, and known faces through live camera feed or uploaded media.  

- **Voice-Based Alerts**  
  Announces detected objects and hazards in real time to help users stay aware and safe.

- **Face Recognition**  
  Helps visually impaired users follow familiar people in public spaces.

- **Shipment & Route Scheduling**  
  Suggests safe and optimized delivery routes based on hazard data and user-provided shipment details.

- **Safety Awareness Prompts**  
  Warns about road signs, traffic zones, and conditions ahead.

---

## 🧩 Why It Matters

Road accidents, poor navigation, and limited accessibility tools remain a challenge for millions worldwide. MooVit offers:

- For visually impaired users → audio alerts to navigate safely  
- For drivers → warnings about hazards & traffic conditions  
- For logistics teams → optimized and safer delivery routes  
- For public safety → early detection of dangerous objects or animals on roads

## 🔍 How to Read This

- The camera feed is processed by YOLO for object and face detection.  
- Detected hazards are sent to the Voice Alert Engine for real-time audio warnings.  
- The Routing & Hazard Engine uses hazard data to optimize routes.  
- The Hazard Database stores risky locations for future predictions.
